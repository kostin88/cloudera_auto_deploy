/**
 * This interface describes a parcel resource and all the operations that can
 * be performed on it. All the commands in this resource are modeled as
 * follows: When you execute a command, for example startDownload, that command
 * simply starts the download and returns right away. This is why they are
 * labeled as a synchronous commands. In order to see the progress of the command
 * a call to {@link ParcelResource#readParcel()} needs to be made. This will
 * show the current stage and any progress information if the parcel is in a
 * transition stage. Eg. DOWNLOADING, DISTRIBUTING etc.
 * If the command for some reason could not execute properly, an error
 * is returned to the user as part of the synchronous command.
 *
 * A Parcel goes through many stages during its lifecycle. The various stages
 * and their order is described on in {@link ApiParcel}
